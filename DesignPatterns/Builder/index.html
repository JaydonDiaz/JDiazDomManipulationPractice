  <h1>Builder Pattern</h1>
  <p>Used to construct complex objects step by step. Instead of having a large constructor with multiple parameters, the
    builder pattern provides a fluent and readable way to create objects by chaining method calls.</p>
  <p>Use when an object has many optional parameters (User profile with optional address, phone, etc.), when an object
    is to complex to construct (A car with multiple parts, like engine, seats, GPS, etc.), or when immutable objects are
    needed.</p>
