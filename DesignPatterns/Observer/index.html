  <h1>Observer Pattern</h1>
  <p>Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents
    (observers) are notified automatically.</p>
  <p>Used in event handling systems, UI updates, and real-time applications (stock tickers, notifications).</p>
